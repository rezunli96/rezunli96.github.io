      <p>Back to four months ago, I could not imagine what I would experience and everything seemed totally unknown to me. When Miss. Fan emailed and told me that I was luckily selected as one of the program students, my highest expectation was just that I would take a good care of myself and had a safe trip there. Writing this report, I am sure what the past four weeks had offered me were far more than a pleasant trip. Around by the relaxing environment of Cornell, both of natural and humanity, it made me think that something should be achieved during this program, otherwise it would be a waste of time and resources if I just wandered and had funs. After four weeks of explorations and endeavor, I believe I had learned a lot and extracted my very potential. All the efforts were worth it, and my ambition has become more clear.</p>

<p>I still remember the first photo I took when I arrived at this serene but fascinating campus: it was took upon the top of the east hill. The nearby medieval style architectures alongside with the mountains of greenery at fat side consisted half of the picture, while the azure sky with few clouds of odd shapes formed another half. No wonder in such lovely environment were people cordial to each other. I still remember the lady constructor would always greet to me with a big smile every time I came across the construction site on the hill. And the grocery clerk would chat about his recent life with a stranger like me without reservation. Though we had also visited the magnificent Niagara, I’d like to say the view of Cornell Campus impressed even more. I will keep that picture deep in my dream.</p>

<p>Academic activities were another thrilling part of the program which benefited us a lot. The excitement of meeting Prof. Jon Kleinberg and Prof. Eva Tardos at present is still lingering in my mind, both of whom are one of the greatest researchers of theoretical CS field in history and authors of classical textbooks we had studied. I felt unreal when I talked to Prof. Eva in face, but I still gained my courage to ask a few questions regarding my own research. Though confused by her accented English speaking, I still could see the calm atmosphere around her and her spirit of master. It was such a precious opportunity that I will not forget forever.</p>

<p>For my own research plan there, I contacted Prof. Qing Zhao of ECE department in previous. She was very hospital to me, and offered me a position of her lab and asked one of her PhD student, Xiao, to guide me. I was allowed to be member of their recent project. Being grateful for such treatment, I decided to make my best contributions to this project. So in these weeks, I was always the first one entering the lab and among the last ones leaving it. With the help of Xiao, I became more and more interested in this topic, which motivated me to learn fast and work with diligence. Finally after four weeks of hard work, we worked out a new algorithm against state-of-art ones, which could be regarded as certain progress. My work earned Prof. Zhao ‘s recognition, and we decided to continue collaboration even after the summer program.</p>

<p>The only regret is that 1 month was too short to experience thoroughly the life there. Nevertheless, I want to express my gratitude for our supervisors, Miss. Fan, Mr. Yu, Mrs. Wu and Jessie, who devoted themselves to keep the program run in normal and take care of all of us. Also I’m grateful for my research Boss here, Prof. Zhao and Xiao, who offered such precious research experience. And I am also want to thank all the people I met in this program. May we meet again in the future.</p>
